# TTYBrain
This simulates a remote teletype sending data for the museum.

### Setup
This is intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi. For the rotary dial, `GPIO2` should be connected through the dial mute, and `GPIO3` should be connected through the dial pulse.

A USB Teletype converter should be connected via USB. 

To start, run `python3 ttyc.py`.
